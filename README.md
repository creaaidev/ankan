# ankan
Simple extension for chromium browsers to get japanese on new tabs.

## List of objectives
Since this extension is mainly for my own personal usage I can
afford to be egoist and focus on my own needs, which not even
I'm sure of, so I try to think of it as a project that will help
me understand it's true meaning throughout it's own development.

ankan should stay a relatively simple but powerful extension,
providing various customization options but keeping the scope
of features true to it's original intention.

The main features the extension should undoutedbly have are:

### What is ankan
Due to the lack of quality of japanese learning related new tab extensions
on the chrome webstore, I decided to create one myself, that would
not only fit my current needs, but possibly future ones too, by 
allowing for a decent degree of customization and various essential features
(not being completely restrained by the learning theme).

This being said, ankan should stay a relatively simple but powerful extension,
providing various customization options but keeping the scope
of features true to it's original intention(Yeah, I have a general idea of it).

The main features the extension are:
- [ ] Display a kanji upon opening a new tab (from a single source) [High Priority]
- [x] Display the current date and time

But, if this were all that the extension would have then it would be quite bad,
numerous other features should be added down the line, but are not of vital
need or might end up deemed unnecessary, so their priority might fluctuate.
- [ ] Alternate between kanji/words source [Low Priority]
- [ ] Fetch new kanji/words from anki decks [High Priority]
- [ ] Fetch new kanji/words from a local file [Low Priority]
- [ ] Change the background of the tab [Medium Priority]
- [ ] Ability to resize the text [Low Priority]
- [ ] Set location and display current weather [Low Priority]
- [ ] Button(s) to search for the kanji/word on popular websites like Jisho.org [Medium Priority]
- [ ] Show image(s) related to the given word [Medium Priority]
- [ ] Get list of (interesting) words/phrases in which the kanji/word appears/phrases [Medium Priority]
- [ ] Save to and load the configuration of a local file [Medium Priority]
- [ ] Take notes [Medium Priority]
